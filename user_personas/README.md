# User Personas

##  Purpose
The `user_personas` directory is dedicated to storing detailed **user personas** that represent different types of users who will interact with our software. These personas help **software developers** and the broader team **understand the intent, needs, and behaviors** of our users, ensuring that the software is designed with the right **features, usability, and user experience** in mind.

##  Structure
Each persona is stored as a separate file (e.g., `persona_name.md` or `persona_name.json`) and follows a **consistent format** for clarity and usability.

##  Persona Format
Each user persona includes the following details:

- **Name** â€“ A fictional name that represents the persona.
- **Role** â€“ The user's primary role in relation to the software.
- **Demographics** â€“ Age, gender, location, occupation, and other relevant details.
- **Goals & Motivations** â€“ What the user hopes to achieve by using the software.
- **Challenges & Pain Points** â€“ Problems, frustrations, or limitations they face.
- **Narrative / Scenario** â€“ A short story illustrating how they interact with the software.

## Example Persona File (Markdown)
Below is an example of how a user persona should be structured in Markdown:
